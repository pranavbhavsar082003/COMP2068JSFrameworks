# Portfolio website
## How I created it
I have used Express.js and hbs(Handlebars templating engine) to make my portfolio professional and there are total four pages Home, About Me, Projects and Contact Me which have four hbs respectively 

## Commands to download express packages and to run the application on the localhost
npm i -g express-generator

express --view=hbs

npm i

npm audit fix --force

nodemon
## How it works 
When you click on the nav links you should be directed to each pages of my portfolio and note that when you click the about it won't change anything but you have to scroll down to see the entire content, also same with other pages because there are four pages in total including the home page itself.
